# COMP2110 Bob's Jobs Frontend

This project implements the front-end code for Bob's Jobs.
level 1 tasks involved the creation and implementation of basic features, such as title, text, navbar, etc for the frontend of the website. It also included creating proper links for the various pages in the website, such as home, about us and applicant help.

level 2 is a bit more advanced compared to level 1, where specific hyperlinks were made for the job listings, where clicking on a job title will lead to another view which displays more information based off that specific job title, such as company name, job details,etc.

level 3 was the start of the implementation of the backend of the server, with the utilisation of strapi. Strapi was used to have all the data stored and through it, linked with visual studio to display its data. With Strapi, the website will now contain miscellaneous information based off the job listings. There would also be a search box, so that users can use its function to manually search for job descriptions.

Level 4 was the final level, where a login form was to be implemented, so that users of the website can access it with their own unique account. The form would make it so that users would have to login to be able to view the job application information. It would of course return a prompt saying incorrect user details if the user didnt login with the correct credentials.
